My relationships start quickly and intensely. I fight with all my might for the attention of the person I want to be involved with; after some time, the fascination passes and is replaced by fear; I have social phobia. The people I stick with have a gigantic influence on me. Generally, I adapt to the company, imitate. People are important to me; I fear loneliness. I can't break off romantic relationships, always end up in long-term relationships, and although I often think of breaking up, I can't do it. I cheated on my partners twice, and I am still with the man from the first affair. I'm a people-pleaser; people generally like me. I have a poor relationship with my family; I don't keep in touch with them at all, except for basic and financial interactions. I don't understand my relationships with others. I'm afraid of my father because he used to beat me; probably why I don't trust men. My first sexual experience felt more like rape; I've been molested a few times, only threatened by a man.";"I scratch a lot, I scratch my legs to blood... I've learned that taking care of the physiological state of the body has a gigantic impact on well-being, so I eat vitamins, and when I feel a panic attack coming, I go eat something, drink water, and walk in the fresh air alone. I named my negative voice in my head; it's called 'the beast,' I observe my thoughts, this is probably called emotional deconstruction, I don't know, but this and letting leaves flow on the river, generally I've picked up a lot of exercises and actively use them, they help. I constructed an anxiety ladder and gradually climbed it and ultimately even reached the peak. I keep a gratitude journal. I've been prescribed medication, lamotrigine, and pregabalin. I recently got off duloxetine and had a depressive episode for a month. Pregabalin helps me a lot. If I have a problem, I write it down physically on paper, in this way I arrange the chaos of thoughts in lines of text, I don't get stuck.";Sometimes I overeat but it's rare now, I've improved my relationship with food, which doesn't mean I don't feel the effects of my eating disorder. I used to use drugs a lot, literally anything that fell into my hands. I drank and drugged away 1.5 years of my life, I stopped drinking alcohol 9 months ago, but I smoke marijuana every day. I excessively spend money. Twice in my life, I cheated on a partner.;My mood changes suddenly and often, I try not to show these emotions so often there is no reaction from the environment. Sometimes I fly in euphoria everywhere, other times I wake up with suicidal thoughts. Evenings are the worst. But I learned to notice the beginnings of these emotional outbursts and calm them down before an eruption occurs. It changes from day to day or from morning to afternoon, it varies. ;Chaotic, warm, stubborn hustler peoplepleaser;I used to feel sadness more often, some time ago it changed and I can feel anger. I can even react. But recently I spat at a guy a few times who pissed me off and I guess that's not okay.; I trust people too much, a few times I've been burned by it. I'm afraid of losing my close ones, I often conduct conversations about abandonment to make sure they still feel it.;Recently there's been more hostility, I don't want to talk to strangers on the street, I prefer to stay within my circle of acquaintances. I'm suspicious, I doubt people close to me.;Today on the tram I felt complete depersonalization, I cried talking to my boyfriend about how there's nothing like 'me,' I'm just a reflection of my environment. I felt that I should completely isolate myself from society and find myself in solitude. It's such a cycle that I constantly fall into, I'm not there, I feel worthless, but I'll improve and be awesome and then doubt again. I have to consciously think about what was valuable to me before I disappeared and what will be again when I return. Because I always come back. Often when watching or reading something, I identify with a character and 'become them.' Today nothing in particular triggered it, but probably domestic violence played a part in it, I don't know.

Relationships with family has been alright, but following the divorce, there has been some strain in between my father and I. Friendships have been very strong.;I keep my mind busy with watching things that make me laught or feel happy. I sometimes do a bit of writing or play a game as a form of escapism. I surround myself with my loved ones and talk whatever bothers me out. I also try to pray more and bring myself closer to God and it brings me peace.;Sometimes I just stop eating. Even if I'm hungry, I will avoid food like I'm punishing myself. Eventually, the next day at some point I feel guilty and make sure that I eat. ;I feel sad a lot. It can be overwhelming and depressing. Some days I feel fine and happy and then out of the blue, the sadness just pops up and I feel like a black cloud on everyone's horizon. Sometimes it's easier to suppress or hide or to get myself out of the sadness. Other times it's not possible. Most of the time when it's overwhelming, I tend to keep away from others until it goes away. If anyone notices the change in mood, they ask and most of the time the reaction is supportive but sometimes I get scolded.;Quiet, caring, anxious, honest, thoughtful;When I feel angry, I try to suppress it and remove myself from the situation in order to calm down. If I'm still angry, I either vent to someone or do some writing to get it out. I don't get angry often.;I usually give people the benefit of the doubt. If someone does not give me any reason to distrust them, I give them a moderate amount of trust. If they give me a reason to be suspicious, then I put distance between myself and them. If it is someone I am already close with then I fear being abandoned. I constantly ask for reassurance, ask them to promise things like never leaving or cheating or whatever.  ;My ex-husband was a drug addict, I used to find his drugs. He would behave strangely at times and I would get suspicious and hyper aware of everything he did or said. 9/10 when he behaved strangely, he was high and I would find his drugs or other proof that he did it. I would confront him and he would deny it every time and gaslight me. Suffice to say, it has made me distrust men a lot. I am working on that.;I have out of body experiences once in a while. It comes during or after panic attacks I get, which happen often. Sometimes I feel like I am not real or like I am a puppet, I am empty. I look at other people and wonder if they feel like this at any point. It makes me wonder if I have no substance, but this is only once in a while. I am not sure what triggers it, maybe it could be existential crisis?

When faced with situations that could potentially evoke anger, I tend to approach them with a calm and rational mindset. I believe in addressing conflicts through effective communication and understanding rather than letting anger dictate my reactions.;I generally approach others with openness and trust, valuing the connections I build. While I do trust people to a reasonable extent, there's a subtle undercurrent of fear of being abandoned. This fear, however, doesn't dominate my interactions, and I consciously strive not to let it dictate my behavior.;I generally approach people with trust and an open mind, striving to foster positive connections. However, like anyone, there may be moments where I experience some level of mistrust or skepticism. In such instances, I try to address these feelings in a constructive manner rather than displaying overt hostility.;While I generally maintain a stable and connected sense of self, there have been instances where I felt a temporary disconnection or emptiness. These moments are sporadic and often triggered by factors such as stress, fatigue, or significant life changes.  One specific instance occurred during a period of intense work pressure and personal challenges. The accumulation of stressors led to a sense of detachment, where I felt somewhat disconnected from my usual sense of self and the reality around me. The feelings of emptiness were a response to the overwhelming nature of the circumstances.  To cope with these experiences, I prioritize self-care and reflection. Engaging in activities that bring joy, seeking support from friends or family, and practicing mindfulness have been effective strategies. By addressing the underlying stressors and taking intentional steps to reconnect with myself, I've found that these moments of disconnection are usually transient.

I don't fear or try to do anything about being abandoned by people. People in everyone's lives come and go, and that's okay. If a relationship isn't working out, I don't waste my energy trying to improve it. Instead, I focus my energy on people who respect me for being myself.;I am a very calm person and I am rarely ever hostile to anyone. I generally don't trust people I haven't known for long. For example, if a stranger asks me to borrow my phone to make a quick phone call, as much as I would like to help, I do not want to risk my phone being stolen.;Living with my mother who I disagree with on many different topics, I do often feel disconnected from her and feel like I don't belong here at all. My relationship with my mother hasn't worked well for years, so it is highly unlikely that it ever will. Instead of trying to change everything about me to make her happy, I will just focus on moving out and living closer to more positive people. No matter who you are and what you do, there will be people who hate you and people who love you for who you are. Instead of trying to make everyone happy, I try to stick with the people who love me for being myself.

I tend to get too close to people and to cling to them, I even become sort of obsessed with them. Sometimes I lose my friends because I'm afraid they will abandon me or they will realize I'm not a good friend, and other times I start creating conflicts and end up having toxic relationships, and people eventually leave. This pattern is also accurate for my romantic relationships, although in those cases I tend to be much more clingy and needy and I become a toxic person myself, because I'm way too unstable and moody and sometimes even aggressive, and I tend to overpower my partner because I'm also very articulate. With romantic partners, I also tend to try to end the relationship quite often when things are bad, but it is more an act to prove if my partner really wants to stay. I think it stems from my fear of being abandoned or not having someone to care 100% about me. This is a source of great shame for me.  ;I used to use methods of self-harm (cutting my body with scissors and stuff life that). I also used to drink myself to unconsciousness or simply to feel less. I stopped drinking for 4 years for this reason. It became an alcohol abuse situation. I also, to this day, tend to starve myself in order to distract myself from the emotional pain or to numb myself or to have a reason to feel bad. Now, I'm a bit healthier and I use other methods when I can (sometimes I can't, mentally or emotionally or phisically). For example, I try to do yoga and to express myself musically (piano or producing on a DAW). I smoke a lot of tobacco and weed. I watch my comfort shows, which I have watched multiple times. I go for a walk with my dog or I take a shower. I also try to be compassionate with myself, and I try to do things to regulate my nervous system, like somatic shaking. ;excessive drinking (in the past), substance abuse (weed and tobacco), verbal outbursts, usually with my boyfriend. Scrolling endleslly on TikTok. ;Every emotion I feel is extreme. Nothing is neutral, everything is charged with an emotion, positive or negative. Sometimes even something that feels good, like listening to a great song or watching a beautiful sunset, can feel painful and uncomfortable because of how strong and intense it is. It's like I don't know what to do with such strong feelings and that makes me feel weird. Even with smells, or just with a slight change in temperature. It's exhausting and it feels like I don't get to control it, like I just have to handle it as it comes, and it is quite unpredictable. It is also very dependent of my menstrual cycle. This intensity includes feeling very strongly about everything and this creates a lot of conflict with the people around me, who must get pretty tired of having me around.;Extremely sensitive, emotional, caring, resilient.;I used to feel a lot more anger before, but lately it has started to come back again, usually with my boyfriend. I've noticed I feel anger when I'm not being understood and when I feel someone is disrespecting me by not listening, not being willing to change certain harmful behaviors, or simply not taking charge. I hate when things are unfair or when I see someone or myself being disrespected or disregarded. I'm a very controlling person, even if I try not to, and I get angry when things get out of my control. ;I do fear abandonment. I think I tend to be manipulative, for example if a want someone to stay, first of all I don't let them know directly because I want it to come from them, so I play mind games and I know exactly what, when and how to say it, even what faces or gestures to make. I also need constant validation and I always fear that I'm not liked or that something that I did is wrong, so I have become a very annoying person, always needing to know what the other person REALLY thinks. This is also exhausting and prevents me from having healthy relationships. ;I'm a very trusting person, surprisingly. I think it's because I'm autistic (but I'm self-diagnosed, so I can't be sure). But I'm very innocent, rarely suspicious of people. I see the best in people almost all the time, and if someone is not to be trusted, i need someone to make me see that. I do, however, try to doubt people's word because I try to interpret what's REALLY going on in their head. Very annoying. ;Yes, I have been noticing this pattern in the last few years, and i noticed this behavior stems from my childhood. I have a very large, very conflictive and intense family, and when the fights or simply the intensity was too much, I used to kind of disconnect mentally and emocionally and phisically too, and just remain silent for a few minutes, unable to connect with my family, simply trying to survive because it was way too much stimulation and it made me feel really bad. Now, every time a situation is too stressful or complicated or the conflict to strong, I disconnect and I either phisically leave, or I just remain silent and can't really communicate. This also comes with a feeling of emptiness, though I usually feel empty when i'm understimulated. I have lived my life trying to fill that hole of emptiness, always, all the time, trying to figure out what to do with myself next, so that I won't feel like that.

My mood doesn't change without reason, only when I recall something negative. If I have positive and pleasant experiences, I generally have a good mood. ;Curious about the world, overly passive, cultured, irritable, unconventional. ;I'm very often angry, usually if I remember some insult, rude behavior or injustice. Sometimes I deal with it by ignoring, sometimes by. ;I'm not afraid of being 'abandoned' because I'm not a child. I trust people moderately - it depends on the person. If I'm not sure about someone's character, I often assume that they don't like me or that their statements are malicious and I have to remind myself that it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. I don't take such actions because I consider them off-putting - my partner had periods when she behaved like that towards me and it was extremely unpleasant for me.;I don't show it;

Sometimes I watch a movie.;Touching my hair.;My mood can be quite variable. I experience both positive and negative emotions, and the intensity of these emotions can fluctuate. Sometimes, I'm filled with joy, enthusiasm, and optimism, which allows me to approach challenges with a positive attitude. On other occasions, I may feel sad, frustrated, or anxious, which can make it more challenging to navigate daily life. My mood influences various life situations. When I'm in a positive mood, I'm more productive at work, and my relationships with others tend to be harmonious. On the flip side, when I'm in a negative mood, it can affect my performance and sometimes strain my relationships.;Determined, Curious, introverted, Creative and Overthinker;I occasionally experience anger, usually in response to situations that challenge my personal boundaries or values. When I do feel anger, I often cope with it by withdrawing from the situation to reflect and process my emotions in solitude.;Assessing my approach to others is something I've learned to do over time. I tend to be a bit cautious, especially when it comes to opening up to new people. Trust doesn't come easily for me, and I usually take my time to build it.;It typically manifests in subtle ways. For example, I may find myself frequently doubting someone's intentions, especially if their actions seem inconsistent with their words. This can lead to a sense of unease and make me question their motives.;These experiences often come about during times of high stress, anxiety, or when I'm overwhelmed. It's like I'm physically present, but my mind and emotions seem distant or detached.  One specific trigger for these feelings of disconnection is when I'm faced with a major life change or a significant loss.

Although I don't usually discuss my feelings with others and I try to remain outwardly stoic, especially in my writing, people can often read my face like a book and can tell how I feel about something. I am able to control my emotions and let go of negative emotions, even if they are very strong in the moment.  I think I am naturally a bit good at this, but also I have a desire to always be in control of myself, so I try to always monitor my actions when emotions are high and force myself out of a situation where I might do something I regret in times where something has made me very angry.;laid back, compassionate, helpful, creative;I very rarely feel anger and tend to feel it a bit less than others would in similar situations because I can let go of negative feelings for the most part.  On very rare occasions, people have made me incredibly angry, but I am always in control of myself during it and I don't let anger take over and control me, for the sake of others' safety even if they are someone I would consider an enemy.;I give everyone a default amount of trust, but with room to doubt and speculate on suspicious actions, especially from strangers.  I trust my close friends and family most of all and I know that they always have my best interests in mind.  I don't worry about anyone abandoning me because that thought seems irrational given that most people like me and I'm friendly and amicable to people.  If someone were to abandon me for some arbitrary reason, I wouldn't worry much about it and would think that the person was probably going through something personal and it is best to let them work through it.;The only mistrust I have is when I have a logical reason to believe that they may be trying to mislead or take advantage of me. High pressure salespeople are the biggest example of this, and I always ignore them and stick with what I originally intended to buy, and will walk away if I feel they don't respect my choices. Strangers who are overly friendly are also suspicious, especially since I live in a bad neighborhood, so it is best to be on guard rather than a victim.  There are also some people who I can tell are manipulative, and I will usually treat what they say and do with a general mistrust and keep an eye on them.  For example, there was once a person who I had just met who insisted on buying sodas for everyone, even though nobody was really thirsty.  Later, he kept looking at expensive products when we were out and complained that he didn't have the money to buy them very obviously in front of each of us.  It was apparent that he was trying to guilt us into spending far more than he did on the off-brand sodas, and I saw right through the manipulative tactic.;The only time I can think of when I felt disconnected from myself or reality were times where I was incredibly sick or incredibly tired.  This is always temporary and is solved by just getting better or being rested.  It never comes about unless it is from a logical source.

There are occasions where I cannot cope with the challenging behaviour and lose my composure. She senses my mood changes and frequently asks if she has done something to upset me. Also, my relationships with work colleagues fluctuates too. When there is a stressful event at work or someone acts in a manner which I interpret as combative towards me, I have difficulty in controlling my emotions.;There was a period approximately 15 years ago, when my relationsip with my partner broke down, that caused me to become severely ill. I was also coping with a life changing injury resulting from a car accident. I was on potent medication to control chronic pain from the injury. My moods were wildly inconsistent and it was worsened by the use of Fentanyl medication to control pain. I made one attempt at suicide and another serious attempt to follow through with the preparation of doing it. I drove randomly across the city looking for a hotel to book into and follow through with my plan. A search party including police was directed to find me, which they did. There have been occassions where my emotional state was so severe that I self harmed, but there was never any incidents of cutting or burning.    ;I went through a long period where I lost control of my spending and ran up debts. The main source of my spending was on investing in crypto which did not end well. I had an episode of verbal outbursts 15 years ago. I lost control and would scream, shout and physically act out by punching walls and kicking any inanimate object. The outbursts were random and caused by the thought of my ex partner starting a relationship with another. This happened immediately after our break up, within hours. Of course there were suspicions beforehand which led to me checking and finding text message communications. My partner played me by making me believe that she needed 6 month break to be single, then all along she continued her relationship with the other. I found out 4 months in and my loss of control was off the scale.;;;;;;

I avoid certain discussions because I am not sure that I could stop myself form verbal explosion with some of my relatives.;My mood goes from highs to lows and from lows to highs for little things. Either I could fight the entire world with no fear or I could not even step out of my home. With time going, highs tend to keep at same intensity and lows are less low. Giving a overall sensation of recovering.;Wounded, alone, purposeless, suffering, recovering.;"I had a period when I felt huge amount of anger every days directed towards some relatives. Resulting of having some ""imaginary"" conservations (not hallucination, solo talking) for hours were I imagined myself insulting them and hurting them. I had some crisis where I broke thing around me in my home. Not hurting peoples because I was alone. Each crisis happened in a few month from the next one. I had three of them.";I have only one relative who I stick with. I trust her and I was very afraid that she put me aside until I discuss that with her. I don't fear she abandon me anymore. I have another relative I care about. Sometime I fear that he put me aside but I stick with the though that I misunderstand his behavior when this fear come. Until now he did not betray me. He has a guidance role with me. I don't trust my other relatives and I don't care if they abandon me. I wish they do.;Some of my relatives are manipulating me / try to manipulate me to make me go their own way. Sometime one of them insult me and it ended in a confrontation but he managed to manipulate me again and I did not see it immediately.;I am fighting to found a purpose to my entire life. I am trying to plan to do things for that. When I can't achieve a step or loose motivation it makes me bad for days. Making me considering suicide.

It happens rarely when i sense that people are trying to use me, for example asking for help for classes. ;I don't think there's a specific trigger. Sometimes, I feel like nothing around me matters that much, but I manage to shrug that feeling off after a couple of seconds or minutes.

Generally, we get along well, we don't argue in any way, but sometimes it's enough that someone doesn't reply to me for one day. Then I start to convince myself that the person doesn't care about me, that they are friends with me out of pity. Usually, I then get very upset about it, I feel worse, but I don't tell them what's bothering me. Only after a long time, when something is really bothering me, I try to talk about it, but only through messages. A face-to-face conversation, about feelings and emotions, is extremely difficult for me and usually ends with me being unable to say anything, and if I try, I start crying. I think it is caused by the fact that many people in my life have rejected me or indeed talked to me out of pity/another reason. I often check whether someone still cares about me, e.g., I won't contact them for a while and wait to see if that person will reach out first.;Usually, I try to occupy my thoughts with something, e.g., I try to play something or do something. When it's worse, I self-harm. I don't know if this can also be included, but I excessively bite my lips, sometimes until they bleed. Sometimes I do it even when I'm completely relaxed.;One of such behaviors in me are verbal outbursts. Because my parents never let me say what was bothering me, they would just yell and tell me to go to my room, often when I argue with someone I start crying and say whatever comes to mind. I do not pay attention to the words I use or to whom I direct them, nor do I look at whether it might hurt someone. Often it then takes me a long time to calm down, and for the rest of the day, I feel terrible.Another such behavior is releasing my emotions on something. More than once because of my outbursts, for example, I threw my phone.;I think that in my case, negative emotions definitely prevail. Sometimes a little is enough for me to get upset and it often sticks with me for the whole day. My close ones usually do not notice my mood changes, until I start showing it more and more clearly, e.g., I reply with one word when someone starts talking to me, I get irritated immediately. As for my parents, their reaction was usually negative. They could not understand that I also have bad days, that today I just do not feel like joking or talking. The only person who understands this is my partner. They know that in such a case I need peace and do not push for any interactions with me.;Rude, shy, isolated, intelligent, creative (?);If I'm to be honest, I can feel anger every day. It often starts with irritation, which stays with me, and then, under the influence of subsequent things, it turns into anger. Usually, I keep it inside, but when the line is crossed, I explode, I start screaming and then crying.;If it comes to people I know and with whom I have a good relationship, I try to be the best version of myself for them, e.g., I can give up many things on a given day just to meet with that person. However, despite everything, I always have the fear that this person will leave me. I wrote earlier that I often do not contact a particular person because I want them to be the first to do it. This is how I check if they still care about me. For two years, I forcibly dragged on a friendship with a certain girl. We knew each other from elementary school, but after going to different schools, she constantly tried to break off contact with me, yet she was never able to say it outright. I couldn't imagine life without her, I tried many times to fix it, but to no avail. Over time, I have come to think that the problem was actually with her. I often asked if she still wanted to maintain contact. Instead of telling me outright what she thought, she would assure me that she did, and then she would ignore me for weeks. It was me who always saw the problem in myself, I tried to force myself to change, I apologized for things that she caused, just to keep the friendship alive.;I think a good example here would be a situation that happened to me many times at school. Many people talked to me, but outside of school, we had no contact at all. We just sometimes exchanged a few words there and that was it. I had the impression that with such a person I was not in any significant relationship, but we liked each other/were neutrally disposed towards each other. However, there have been many situations that showed I was naive to think that way. For instance, when my acquaintance was talking to my friend. I was literally standing next to this friend. Many times, I thought he was also talking to me. But then I realized that he was only addressing my friend and if he was showing something on the phone, it was also only to her. And yet, I was standing next to them and participated in the conversation to a small extent. So why was he ignoring me?;When it comes to the feeling of emptiness, I experience it daily. My happy life evaporated along with the end of the year 2019. I don't remember the last time I was happy. Although I laugh sincerely when I am in a group of friends, I could not say that I am happy at that moment. That would be a lie. Most of the time, I don't feel anything. From time to time, it happens that I burst out because I hold too many emotions inside.
